# AI-BASED-LIVER DAMAGE DETECTION
# BUSINESS PROBLEM:
Current liver damage detection relies heavily on manual analysis by hepatologists, making early diagnosis and risk assessment time-consuming and prone to human error. By leveraging Al-driven models to analyze histopathology images and patient healthcare data, we can provide detailed insights to assist hepatologists in making more accurate and timely decisions for early intervention.
# BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
Maximize early detection accuracy.

# BUSINESS CONSTRAINT:
Minimize false positive/negative rates.

# SUCCESS CRITERIA:
# Business Success Criteria: 
Reduce manual efforts in liver damage assessment by 20-30% through Al- driven insights.
# ML Success Criteria: 
Achieve a prediction accuracy more than 85% in detecting liver damage.
# Economic Success Criteria: 
Achieve at least a 15% cost reduction in diagnosis by minimizing errors and optimizing workflows.
