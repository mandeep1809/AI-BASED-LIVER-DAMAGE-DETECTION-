# AI-BASED-LIVER DAMAGE DETECTION
# BUSINESS PROBLEM:
Current liver damage detection relies heavily on manual analysis by hepatologists, making early diagnosis and risk assessment time-consuming and prone to human error. By leveraging Al-driven models to analyze histopathology images and patient healthcare data, we can provide detailed insights to assist hepatologists in making more accurate and timely decisions for early intervention.
# BUSINESS OBJECTIVE:
Maximize early detection accuracy.

# BUSINESS CONSTRAINT:
Minimize false positive/negative rates.
